# Client-Server

<h2>Build a simple client-server system, where you use the client to chat with a server. The protocol between the client and server is as follows.</h2>
  <p>1.The server is first started on a known port.</p>
  <p>2.The client program is started (server IP and port are provided on the command line).</p>
  <p>3.The client connects to the server and then asks the user for input.</p>
  <p>4.The user types his message on the terminal.</p>
  <p>5.The user's input is sent to the server via the connected socket.</p>
  <p>6.The server reads the user's input from the client socket.</p>
  <p>7.The client then reads the reply from the server.</p>
  <p>8.The server must reply to the client.</p>
  <p>9.The client asks the user for the next message to send to the server.</p>
